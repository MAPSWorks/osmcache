Small web application that uses [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) to
show map data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). Location
tracking is used and a few simple options are available so that the page
can be used for basic [Geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/).

The site can be found at [https://j0r1.github.io/osmcache/](https://j0r1.github.io/osmcache/).
